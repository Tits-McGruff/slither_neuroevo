## Archive policy: /todo/archive

The directory `/todo/archive` is for archival purposes only.

You must not edit, reformat, rename, move, or delete any file under `/todo/archive`. Do not open pull requests that include changes to archived files, and do not propose “cleanup” edits such as linting, updating dependencies, fixing typos, reorganizing folders, or normalizing formatting inside the archive. Treat the contents as read-only historical records.

Assume that information contained in archived files is outdated. Use it only as background context to understand what has already been attempted, decided, or completed in the past. Do not treat archived content as an authoritative source of current requirements, current architecture, current APIs, current configurations, or current plans. If an archived file conflicts with current documentation, current code, current issues, or current tasks, you must follow the current sources and treat the archived file as historical context only.

If you need to preserve something new for historical record, create a new archive entry outside of any existing archived file, following the repository’s current conventions for archiving. Do not modify prior archived materials to “bring them up to date”.
